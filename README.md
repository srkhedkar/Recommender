Building Recommender System Using Machine Learning Techniques And Python:

Recommender system is an important and a popular area of machine learning. It has helped business to increase their sales and profits. We cannot imagine a market place today which is not having any recommender system in place. These companies analyse our transaction data; they try to deduce our buying patterns. From the buying patterns they create association rules. These association rules are then used to form recommendations and deals. There are various data mining algorithms such as k-means, Page Rank, EM data mining, and Apriori which are used to build the recommender systems. In this article we are going to build our recommender system using Apriori algorithm.
